# Wishing Hand 3D model
Wishing Hand by Linda Brunker - 3D model reconstruction

The 3D model constructed is a detailed reconstruction of the Dublin landmark that sits in the middle of the Department of Education. It is called the Wishing Hand by Linda Brunker. It consists of a hand sculpture and a circular base and was recreated using photogrammetry. The purpose of this reconstruction was to generate this realistic 3D model that can be used for a virtual field trip.

Agisoft Metashape was the software used to generate the model from a set of high resolution images taken from multiple angles to capture every minute detail. This software processed these images into a dense point cloud and were subsequently converted into a mesh. I had to use Agisoft metashape since Meshroom isn’t supported on Mac. The raw 3D model contained noise, irregular edges and unwanted fragments. Blender was utilised to conduct the post-processing. It was mainly used to clean up this unwanted geometry, improve the model’s accuracy and enhance its visual appeal.
